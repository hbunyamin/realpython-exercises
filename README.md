# Real Python Exercises

This is the repo to write [_Realpython_ codes](https://realpython.com).    
Mostly, the codes are for Python Web Development (**Flask**).    
   
In order to run the code, we need to create a __virtual environment__, as follows:     
```
$ conda create -n flask-env python=3.9 pip flask
$ conda activate flask-env
```
